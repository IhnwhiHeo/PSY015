# Coming up with research ideas

## A big picture about psychology and research question

### What is psychology? (PSY001)

--

- ### Scientific study on how people think, feel, and behave

- ### Research questions across various subdisciplines

--

### How do we study research questions in psychology? (PSY010 and PSY015)

--

- ### Statistical methods

- ### Variables and relationships between them

---

# Coming up with research ideas

## Example 1

### Are you a graduate student?

## Is this a strong and workable psychological research question?

--

### Not about how people think, feel, and behave

### Not concerned with relationships between variables

### A better version would be "Is being a state of graduate students associated with psychological well-being?"

---

# Coming up with research ideas

## Example 2

### Do therapies work?

## Is this a strong and workable psychological research question?

--

### Too broad... Which therapies? What do you mean by 'work'?

### A better version would be "Does going through cognitive-behavioral therapy sessions increase self-esteem?"

---

# Coming up with research ideas

## Example 3

### What is the impact of extreme temperatures and material density on the room-temperature superconductor?

## Is this a strong and workable psychological research question?

--

### Is not psychological in nature...

### Is not workable with methods and statistics that psychologists typically use

---

# Coming up with research ideas

## Tips on coming up with research ideas

### Start from psychological phenomena you are interested in <br> (social, cognitive, health, educational, developmental, cultural, clinical, quantitative, etc.)

### Which specific thoughts, behaviors, or feelings do you want to focus on?

### Identify specific and measurable (either directly or indirectly) variables and think about relationships between them

### What are the independent variable (IV) and the dependent variable (DV)? <br> IV (aka. predictor): A variable researchers manipulate/change; assumed to affect the DV <br> DV (aka. outcome): A variable being tested and measured; dependent on the IV


---

# Coming up with research ideas

## An example from Steinmetz et al. (2016)

### Start from psychological phenomena you are interested in <br> I am interested in human behavior within the social context (i.e., social psychology)

### Which specific thoughts, behaviors, or feelings do you want to focus on? <br> social cognition, presence of others, self-perception

### Identify specific and measurable variables and think about relationships between them <br> Being observed or not, eating behavior, and maybe the relationship between these two?

### What are the independent variable and the dependent variable? <br> IV: being observed or not; DV: eating behavior

---

# Coming up with research ideas

## Other examples?

### Does taking daily nature walks improve high school students' academic achievement? <br> IV: exposure group (those who talk in nature vs. control); DV: academic performance

### Can exposure to bright colors affect blood pressure in healthy adults? <br> IV: exposure to bright colors or not; DV: blood pressure

### Are K-pop tastes related to introversion or extroversion in young adults? <br> IV: favorite type of K-pop; DV: level of introversion or extroversion

---

# Coming up with research ideas

## Assignment 1 rubrics

### Should be something academically interesting (i.e., new contribution, different perspective)

### Should be psychological, clear, workable, and something about relationships between variables

### Should identify the independent variable and the dependent variable

### Should be **three research ideas** and **choose one out of three you want to work with**!


---
